  <h1>Swarm</h1>
  <h2>Palm Reader</h2>
  <h4 class="author">Martin</h4>
  <p>You'll instantly know if this band are for you from this song, which immediately turns up to 11 and let's you know it means business. It's not just a 3 minute onslaught though, demonstrating dynamics and timing changes, and that Palm Reader know how to write songs that are complex but catchy. I first heard this live when they supported The Contortionist at Deaf Institute, Manchester and went mad when they played this song.</p>

One Day as a Lion - If You Fear Dying
Martin

This band are one of the reasons I bought my synth. When I heard my favourite drummer (Jon Theodore) was starting a side project with Zach de la Roche my excitement was palpable, but my expectations were surpassed with their self-titled 5 track EP, which tragically remains the only music they've put out.

Ohhms - Murder is Murder is Murder
Martin

THETA played our first gig in march after a year of writing and rehearsing. To celebrate we had a night out in Manchester (our last before lockdown) which among other things involved seeing Ohhms play at Satans Hollow. They didn't play this song, but it's my favourite of theirs so it makes the list. Sorry Ohhms, we were the tipsy bunch still trying to chat to you after the bouncers had told everyone to leave.

Rocket falls on Rocket falls - Godspeed You! Black Empower
Matt

If this song was a book, it would be akin to a Dickens novel. More a collaborative forum of musicians, rather than a typical song, once listened to it certainly leaves a mark. It's long, but totally worth it. For me, songs should always carry a message or promote a journey and this certainly does the job. Though a more depressing take on life and the prospect of abandonment, there are moments in it which offer optimism. A great metaphor for life in my humble opinion.

The Line Between - Baroness
Matt

For me this one is probably one of Baroness' 'under the radar' songs. After a small, ambient introduction followed by a rumbling build up of flat out guitars and drums, the whole thing is like a rollercoaster. 3 minutes of chaos. And I like to think I am most of that chaos in Theta, much to everyone else's frustrations. Fast, loud and aggressive. Perfect.

Ummon - SLIFT
Sylvie

Three words describe why this is my jam: heavy psychedelic rock. When a three piece can make this much noise and give all the ups and downs, grooves, pumping riffs and weirdness all at the same time, just yes. Also shoutout to KEXP for being one of the reasons I discover gems like this.

Anything you want - Jessica Lea Mayfield
Sylvie

The polar opposite of my last track, sometimes it’s good to keep it simple and that’s all it needs. Angsty female led music will always speak to me (shout out to women in rock!) and this just hits the Seattle-grunge sound on the head. I’m here for it. 

@Glyn if you don’t put WHORES down then sort it out, as they are pretty much responsible for creating the first iteration of the band!

Daddy’s Money - Whores

Pretty much the reason this band started. Whores take the catchy riffs of Helmet, turn on all the fuzz and lather it with post-gen-x nihilism. You won’t find solos, massive key changes, dynamic changes - what you find in Whore’s is straight up fight music. Never underestimate a catchy riff and straight to the point groove.

309 (Live at Dunk! Fest) - Russian Circles

Russian Circles is pretty much the mash up of heavy vs beautiful for me. They write these amazing sections that blend beautiful between each other. Just when you think the song is starting to come to a close they come out of this calm into an almost molten lava riff. It would be hard to deny the influence they have had on my own playing dynamics.

Dead Roots Stirring - Elder

It’s almost unfair listening to the musical talent of Elder. How can 3 (now 4) musicians possess such talent. Obviously coming from an unapologetic fanboy of Elder. This song is an absolute perfect jumping off point for anyone who has never listened to them. Starting in this very chill psychedelic origin building into this fuzzy lick heavy stoner middle section and finally going full circle back to the opening.

Scapegoat - Kylesa
Sylvie

For those times when you just want to get hyped up and shout at things. It makes me feel a bit punk and I like the idea of bringing a bit of anarchy to the band.

A History of Bad Men - Melvins
Sylvie

Alright Glyn didn’t put them on his list so I added it to mine (sorry not sorry!) I just didn’t feel right that this track wasn’t on the list. The drums in this track are lush and it’s got that heavy groove which is totally my jam. You’re welcome.
